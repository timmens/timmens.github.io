Hey! I’m Tim, a fourth-year PhD student in economics at the [Bonn Graduate School of
Economics](https://www.bgse.uni-bonn.de/en/people/student-directory/2020/tim-mensinger).

I’m into econometrics & statistics, structural microeconometrics, causal
inference, and programming. Besides that, I greatly advocate for reproducibility, the
open-source philosophy, and sustainability.

Primarily, I studied economics at the University of Bonn, but I also attended
lectures/took exams in mathematics and computer science. For more details on my
education, see my [curriculum vitae](/cv/). Also, check out my
[GitHub](https://github.com/timmens) to have a look at my projects.
