Hey! I'm Tim, a second-year PhD student in economics at the [Bonn Graduate School in
Economics](https://www.bgse.uni-bonn.de/en/people/student-directory/2020/tim-mensinger).

Broadly speaking, I'm interested in econometrics &#38; statistics, structural
microeconometrics, and causal inference. I also love programming, especially in Python,
which is why I have a thing for large computational projects. At the moment, my sweet
spot lies in the intersection between the development/extension of methods and their
computer implementation in an extensible/modular fashion. Like many modern researchers,
I care a great deal about reproducibility and the open-source philosophy.

For the most part, I studied economics at the University of Bonn, but I also attended
some lectures/took exams in mathematics and computer science. For more details on my
education see my [curriculum vitae](/cv/). To view some of my old projects, check out my
[GitHub](https://github.com/timmens).

If you want to work with me, extend one of my projects or simply have a chat, feel free
to contact me via email or any other social network. You find my contact information
