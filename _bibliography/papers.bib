  abstract = {While a substantial literature on structural break change point analysis
              exists for univariate time series, research on large panel data models has
              not been as extensive. In this paper, a novel method for estimating panel
              models with multiple structural changes is proposed. The breaks are
              allowed to occur at unknown points in time and may affect the multivariate
              slope parameters individually. Our method adapts Haar wavelets to the
              structure of the observed variables in order to detect the change points
              of the parameters consistently. We also develop methods to address
              endogenous regressors within our modeling framework. The asymptotic
              property of our estimator is established. In our application, we examine
              the impact of algorithmic trading on standard measures of market quality
              such as liquidity and volatility over a time period that covers the
              financial meltdown that began in 2007. We are able to detect jumps in
              regression slope parameters automatically without using ad-hoc subsample
              selection criteria.},
